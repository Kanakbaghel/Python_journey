# Day 51: Introduction to Scikit-learn

## Overview
Welcome to Day 51 of the 100 Days of Python Challenge for Data Science! Today, we dive into Scikit-learn, a powerful and user-friendly machine learning library in Python. Scikit-learn provides tools for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and more, making it essential for data scientists. This session covers the fundamentals to get you started with building your first ML models.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this day, you will:
- Understand the core components of Scikit-learn (datasets, estimators, transformers).
- Learn to load and preprocess datasets.
- Perform train-test splits for model validation.
- Train a simple classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression).
- Evaluate model performance using basic metrics like accuracy.
- Gain familiarity with Scikit-learn's API for reproducibility and ease of use.

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge (variables, loops, functions).
- Familiarity with NumPy and Pandas (for data handling).
- Install Scikit-learn: Run `pip install scikit-learn` in your terminal.

## Files in This Repository
- `day51_scikit_learn_intro.py`: Python script demonstrating Scikit-learn basics using the Iris dataset.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x and Scikit-learn installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Run the script: `python day51_scikit_learn_intro.py`.
4. Observe the output: The script loads data, trains a model, makes predictions, and prints accuracy.

## Code Explanation
The Python script (`day51_scikit_learn_intro.py`) walks through:
- Importing Scikit-learn modules.
- Loading the Iris dataset (a classic classification dataset with 150 samples of iris flowers).
- Splitting data into training and testing sets (80/20 split).
- Training a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
- Predicting on the test set and evaluating accuracy.

This is a hands-on introduction—experiment by changing the model or dataset!
