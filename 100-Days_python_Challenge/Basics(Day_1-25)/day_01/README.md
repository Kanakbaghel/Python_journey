## 1. Installing Python

Python is a popular, easy-to-learn programming language widely used for web development, data science, automation, and more.

### Step-by-step installation:

1. **Download Python:**

   - Visit the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Download the latest stable version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

2. **Run the Installer:**

   - **Windows:**  
     - Run the downloaded `.exe` file.  
     - **Important:** Check the box **Add Python to PATH** before clicking "Install Now".  
     - Follow the prompts to complete installation.

   - **macOS:**  
     - Open the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the instructions.  
     - Alternatively, use Homebrew:  
       ```bash
       brew install python
       ```

   - **Linux:**  
     - Use your package manager, e.g., for Ubuntu/Debian:  
       ```bash
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
       ```

3. **Verify Installation:**

   Open a terminal or command prompt and type:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

   You should see the installed Python version.

## 2. Installing Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is an interactive web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

### Installation steps:

1. **Install via pip (Python package manager):**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

2. **Verify Installation:**

   Run:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This command will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open the interface in your default web browser.

## 3. Installing Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

VSCode is a free, powerful, and lightweight code editor with great support for Python development.

### Installation steps:

1. **Download VSCode:**

   - Visit [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Download the installer for your operating system.

2. **Install VSCode:**

   - Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.

3. **Install Python Extension:**

   - Open VSCode.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` (`Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
   - Search for **Python** by Microsoft.
   - Click **Install**.

4. **Configure Python Interpreter:**

   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) to open the Command Palette.
   - Type `Python: Select Interpreter` and select the Python version you installed.

## 4. Creating and Running Your First Python Script

### Steps:

1. **Create a Python file:**

   - Open VSCode.
   - Click **File > New File**.
   - Save the file as `hello.py`.

2. **Write your first Python code:**

   ```python
   print("Hello, world!")
   ```

3. **Run the script:**

   - Open the integrated terminal in VSCode (`Ctrl+`` or `View > Terminal`).
   - Run the script by typing:

     ```bash
     python hello.py
     ```

   - You should see the output:

     ```
     Hello, world!
     ```

## 5. Creating and Running Your First Jupyter Notebook

### Steps:

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

   - Your default browser will open the Jupyter interface.

2. **Create a new notebook:**

   - Click **New > Python 3** (or your installed Python version).

3. **Write your first notebook cell:**

   ```python
   print("Hello, Jupyter!")
   ```

4. **Run the cell:**

   - Press `Shift + Enter` or click the **Run** button.
   - The output will appear below the cell:

     ```
     Hello, Jupyter!
     ```

## 6. Additional Tips

- **Using VSCode with Jupyter Notebooks:**

  VSCode supports Jupyter notebooks natively. You can open `.ipynb` files directly in VSCode and run cells interactively.

- **Managing Python packages:**

  Use `pip` to install additional packages:

  ```bash
  pip install package_name
  ```

- **Virtual Environments:**

  To avoid package conflicts, consider using virtual environments:

  ```bash
  python -m venv myenv
  source myenv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
  myenv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
  ```
