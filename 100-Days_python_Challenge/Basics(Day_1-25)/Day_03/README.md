# Python Basics: Input, Output, and Print Formatting

This guide provides a clean and clear introduction to basic input/output operations in Python, focusing on using `input()`, `print()`, and string formatting with f-strings.

## Getting User Input

In Python, you can get input from the user using the built-in `input()` function.

- The `input()` function reads a line from input (usually from the user), converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
```

- The prompt string inside `input()` is optional but recommended to guide the user.

- By default, `input()` returns a string. To get other data types, you need to convert the input explicitly:

## Summary

- Use `input()` to get user input as strings.
- Convert input to other types as needed (`int()`, `float()`, etc.).
- Use `print()` to display output.
- Use f-strings (`f"..."`) for clean and readable string formatting.
- Format numbers and align text easily with f-string syntax.
