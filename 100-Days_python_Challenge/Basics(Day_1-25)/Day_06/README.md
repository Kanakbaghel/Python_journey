# Loops in Programming: `for` and `while`

## Overview
Loops are fundamental control structures that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. The two primary types of loops are:

- **`for` loops**: Iterate over a sequence (like a range, list, or other collections).
- **`while` loops**: Repeat as long as a condition remains true.

## `for` Loops

### Purpose
Use `for` loops when you know the number of iterations or want to iterate over elements in a collection.

### Syntax (Python example)
```python
for element in collection:
    # code block
```

---

## `while` Loops

### Purpose
Use `while` loops when the number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on a condition.

### Syntax
```python
while condition:
    # code block
```

## Key Points

- **`for` loops** are ideal for iterating over fixed sequences or collections.
- **`while` loops** are suited for indefinite iteration based on dynamic conditions.
- Always ensure loop termination conditions to avoid infinite loops.
- Use `break` and `continue` statements to control loop flow when necessary.

## Practice Exercises

1. Use a `for` loop to print all even numbers between 2 and 40.
2. Iterate over a list of names and print each name in uppercase.
3. Use a `while` loop to sum numbers from 1 to 100.
4. Create a `while` loop that asks for user input until the user types "exit".

Mastering loops enables efficient and clean code for repetitive tasks. Practice iterating over ranges and collections to build strong foundational skills.
