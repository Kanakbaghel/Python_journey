# Day 25: Practice Problems Combining Basics

Welcome to Day 25! Todayâ€™s focus is on applying your knowledge of **loops**, **functions**, and **data structures** to solve practical problems. These exercises will help you integrate core Python concepts and build problem-solving skills.

---

## Tips for Solving These Problems

- Break down the problem into smaller steps.
- Use loops to iterate over data structures.
- Use functions to organize and reuse code.
- Use appropriate data structures (`list`, `set`, `dict`) based on the problem.
- Test your functions with different inputs, including edge cases.

---

## Summary

- These problems combine loops, functions, and data structures.
- Practice helps solidify your understanding and prepares you for more complex challenges.
- Keep experimenting and refining your solutions.
