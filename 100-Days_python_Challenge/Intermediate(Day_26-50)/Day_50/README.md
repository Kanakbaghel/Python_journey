# 🐍 100 Days of Python: Day 50 📅

## Practice Intermediate-Level Data Manipulation Problems

### 🎯 Objective

Day 50 is a practice day designed to solidify skills in intermediate-level data manipulation, aggregation, and basic visualization using Python's essential data science libraries: **NumPy** and **Pandas**. We will work with a simulated dataset to perform realistic analytical tasks.

### 🧠 Concepts Covered

* **Pandas DataFrames:** Creation, selection, and filtering of data.
* **Data Aggregation:** Grouping data using `groupby()` and calculating summary statistics (e.g., mean, sum).
* **NumPy Integration:** Using NumPy functions for efficient numerical operations within Pandas.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating basic plots (like bar charts) to visualize aggregated results using Matplotlib (often integrated with Pandas).

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

You must have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
