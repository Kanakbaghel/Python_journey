# Day 36: Introduction to Matplotlib for Data Visualization

## Introduction
Welcome to Day 36 of the 100 Days Python Challenge! Today, we explore data visualization using Matplotlib, a powerful Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive plots. Matplotlib is the foundation for many visualization tools in Python and integrates seamlessly with Pandas and NumPy.

By the end of this day, you'll learn how to:
- Set up Matplotlib for plotting.
- Create basic plots: line plots (for trends over time) and scatter plots (for relationships between variables).
- Customize plots with labels, titles, colors, and legends.
- Save plots to files for sharing or reports.

This is crucial for data analysis, as visualizations help communicate insights from data effectively.

## Objectives
- Understand the basics of Matplotlib's pyplot interface.
- Generate line plots to show trends (e.g., time-series data).
- Generate scatter plots to visualize correlations (e.g., between two variables).
- Customize and save plots for practical use.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python (variables, lists, functions).
- Familiarity with Pandas and NumPy (from previous days; install via `pip install pandas numpy` if needed).
- Matplotlib installation: `pip install matplotlib`.
- Python 3.x environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook for interactive plotting).

## Key Concepts
1. **Pyplot Interface**: Matplotlib's `pyplot` module provides a MATLAB-like interface for plotting (e.g., `plt.plot()` for lines, `plt.scatter()` for points).
2. **Figure and Axes**: A "figure" is the overall window, and "axes" are the plotting areas within it.
3. **Customization**: Add titles, labels, legends, and styles to make plots informative.
4. **Saving Plots**: Use `plt.savefig()` to export plots as images (e.g., PNG, PDF).

## Code Structure
The provided Python script (`day36.py`) includes:
- Importing necessary libraries (Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy).
- Creating sample data (e.g., time-series and random points).
- Generating a line plot and a scatter plot.
- Customizing plots with labels and saving them.
- Printing confirmation messages.

## Usage
1. Download or copy the `day36.py` script.
2. Run it in your Python environment:
